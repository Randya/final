                        <p>
                            It's important to think about math in a realistic manner, and to do so you must understand a little bit about it's history. Without getting too boring with it,
                            just know that math has been around for many thousands of years. There is no sense in beating yourself up too badly if you can't ingest what it took millions of people
                            thousands of years to come up with right away. It is certainly going to be tough. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="hidden-xs">Based on the above knowledge, work hard at your studies in mathematics, but do not hesitate to take a break when you feel like you are at wit's end. There is
                            a good likelihood that you really are, and without frequent breaks you will burn yourself out. As a student, you can't afford this so you'll need to learn your limits.

                        <p>
                            It's a little more important to eat right than many people think. Several factors come into play concerning diet, and each of them play an important role to the outcome
                            of your success. Eating foods that feed the mind will help you think clearly, but as well, it will keep you from becoming frustrated or "fizzled out" so quickly.

                        <h3>Good Study Habits</h3>

                        <p>
                            How you study can mean everything when trying to learn something of complexity. You should probably take a moment to evaluate how you learn the best. For
                            some people, visual props help the best. For others, reading and taking notes is the right path. Myself personally, I learn best by repetition. There are many books and
                            Youtube videos out there that talk about both learning styles, as well as different forms of note taking. If time is permitted, I highly suggest looking into this. It will help you
                            in all fields of study, and not just math.
